# Neovim Setup

### Currently Using:


### Completion
I used Deoplete completion for a long time, with different plugins (see the folder withDeoplete_old)
Now I'm testing coc.nvim

Completions sources:
- Terraform: [terraform-ls](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) by Hashicorp (You can use hashicorp-lsp but I prefer to use the ls, it's younger and with more dynamic development)
