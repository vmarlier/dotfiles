*send.vim* Git add, git commit, git pull, git push all in one command, without leaving vim.

Typing :Send <commit message> in the vim ex command will automatically run the following commands in your shell:

git add (everything in current git repository)
git commit -m '<commit message>'
git pull origin (the current git branch)
git push origin (the current git branch)

You can change "Send" to another command by adding

let g:GitSendPrefix = '<my command>'

to your .vimrc
